# StockScreener
StockScreener is a Python application that uses Selenium, BeautifulSoup, time, requests, and webbrowser to open multiple pages of information regarding stock tickers that return on my Stock filter. It opens as many pages as the user requests in one click. This has saved time for me allowing me to research each stock with ease.

## Technologies
Selenium - I have learned how to use Selenium to search HTML on a page and pull multiple links from a page.
BeautifulSoup - Parse HTML to find the correct values and apply them to a variable that can be used with webbrowser.
VIM - This is my first time using VIM and it has significantly improved my coding speed.
